1. search the ingredient database for any ingredient in the database. if there is any match then we set the ingredient(1) = match
if not then we ask user to manually add ingredient for us into the database(to be implemented). I will build a dummy database for ingredient first.
I suggest we try to find some opensource ingredient database. If we can not find any we can use a dummy database that we can build gradually during the developing process.

2. after we find the ingredient in the database we will then parse the number from it.
 
parsed_ingredient_str = '500 grams of beef'
